Jailbreak tweak to spoof for the Exchange/ActiveSync user-agent on iOS9.

## About

This tweak "tricks" Exchange servers into thinking you're on a different device/iOS version.

There are some built-in devices/versions, or there is an option to manually enter the User-Agent string. I found the list of User-Agent strings at http://justworks.ca/blog/ios-and

## Development

This was my first jailbreak tweak. I documented some of the steps I took on a wiki: https://github.com/derv82/Exchangent/wiki
